# VisualGraphs

## Usage

```ruby
#simple not weighted graph
# json import
graph = Graph.load_from_json(path)

#initialization from hash
hash_graph = {1 => [2, 3], 2 => [1, 4]}
graph = Graph.adjacency_list_init(hash_graph)

graph.vertices #return list of vertices
graph.edges #return list of edges
```
```ruby
#adding new vertex (vertex could be numbers,chars .etc)
# if vertex is already exists it will not be added
graph.insert_vertex(new_vertex)
```
```ruby
#adding new edge for simple Graph
# vertices will also be included in vertices list of graph if they are not there
# also add second_vertex to adjacency_list of first_vertex 
graph.insert_edge([first_vertex, second_vertex])
```
```ruby
graph.output_to_standard_stream # prints graph(adjacency_list)
```
```ruby
#will create(overwrite) json_file and save adjacency_list in it
#json_file name must ends with .json 
graph.dump_to_json(path_to_file)
```

```ruby
WeightedGraph - weighted_adjacency_list

# json import
# will raise error if 
graph = WeightedGraph.load_from_json(path)

#initialization from hash
hash_graph = {1 => [[2, 3]], 2 => [[1, 4]]}
graph = WeightedGraph.adjacency_list_init(hash_graph)

graph.vertices #return list of vertices
graph.edges #return list of edges

#v1,v2 vertices,w - weight
graph.insert_edge([v1,[v2,w]])
```

## Data formats

```
for simple not weighted Graph class
{
  "1":[2],
  "2":[3],
  "3":[1,4]
  "4": []
}

hash = {1 => [2,3]}

for weightedGraph 
{
  "1":[[2,1]],
  "2":[[3,4]],
  "3":[[1,5],[4,6]]
  "4": []
}

hash = {1 => [[2,3], [3,4]]}

```


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'visual_graphs'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install visual_graphs

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
